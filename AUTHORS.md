### Background
With over 20 years of experience as a software systems architect, I witnessed a profound shift when LLM-powered coding tools like AI-assisted development emerged. While colleagues wielded these tools like magic to deliver impressive results, I noticed a critical gap: the prompts driving these outcomes remained invisible, undocumented, and unshared. This realization sparked POG as a framework to elevate prompts from ephemeral inputs to first-class artifacts worthy of the same rigor we apply to code itself.
