# POG Framework Comparisons

This section provides detailed comparisons between POG (Prompt Orchestration Governance) and other prompt management approaches and methodologies.

---

## Overview

POG describes patterns we observe when teams manage prompts at organizational scale. To help contextualize how it relates to other approaches, we compare it with other established methodologies:

- **[PDD - Prompt-Driven Development](pdd.md)**: Development methodology centered on prompts as primary development artifacts
- **[PDE - Prompt-Driven Engineering](pde.md)**: Engineering approach focused on prompt-first system design

Each approach has different strengths and applies best to different contexts. This section explores those differences.

## Comparison Dimensions

Our comparisons evaluate each approach across multiple dimensions:

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use POG When:
- You need enterprise-wide prompt governance
- Managing prompts across multiple teams and projects
- Requiring auditability and compliance
- Seeking SDLC-wide optimization
