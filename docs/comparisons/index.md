# POG Framework Comparisons

This section provides detailed comparisons between POG (Prompt Orchestration Governance) and other prompt management approaches and methodologies.

---

## Overview

POG represents a comprehensive framework for managing prompts as first-class software assets. To help understand its unique value proposition, we compare it with other established methodologies and approaches:

- **[PDD - Prompt-Driven Development](pdd.md)**: Development methodology centered on prompts as primary development artifacts
- **[PDE - Prompt-Driven Engineering](pde.md)**: Engineering approach focused on prompt-first system design

## Comparison Dimensions

Our comparisons evaluate each approach across multiple dimensions:

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use POG When:
- You need enterprise-wide prompt governance
- Managing prompts across multiple teams and projects
- Requiring auditability and compliance
- Seeking SDLC-wide optimization
